# Onlineshop
This is an online shop where customers must sign in for the sales and purchases of their items. The user can load pictures about this item. To do so, I used Oracle database (SQL),JPA API, Java  and JSP.
I did the project in July 2019 at Future Training & Consulting (an organizational training) with a book https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/professionell-entwickeln-mit-java-ee-8_4243/
